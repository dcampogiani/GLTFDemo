All the data is taken from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

## Android

On Android, the rendering is implemented with [Google Filament](https://github.com/google/filament)

## iOS

On iOS at the moment I'm just getting the models, but the rendering is missing :scream:

Google filament [has a tutorial for iOS](https://google.github.io/filament/posts/cocoapods/) if any iOS dev would like to accept the challenge
